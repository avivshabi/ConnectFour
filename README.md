# Connect Four

A Connect Four game implementation in C# with a very naive AI algorithm and WinForms UI.  
This is a school project created as part of the course "Object Oriented Programming with C# and .NET" I enrolled in during my studies.

## Structure

The project is made up of 2 independent parts such that any UI implementation can be integrated with the backend.

## Game Modes

-   Single Player (Play against AI)
-   2 Players

## Technologies

.NET, C#, WinForms
